A dialectical \u201cAufhebung\u201d of something is not the same as simply leaving the transcended something behind, deconstructing, cancelling, and abandoning it. Aufhebung means transcending, retaining, transforming, and improving at the same time, literally; to raise something to a new level, mainly by recontextualising it. This can be done by rethinking these terms within a comprehended praxis-research framework."

Praxis-research may require practitioner-research. But, still, not all forms of practitioner research qualify as praxis-research, as when practitioners merely apply conventional research methods (observing the behaviour of others, reading documents, and asking questions). Practitioner-research may be necessary but still not sufficient for praxis-research. As I have tried to clarify elsewhere, even within what might be called informed Aristotelian praxis-research there are important differences which, although there is no space for it here, need to be addressed.4 My presentation here may"

Flyvbjerg, 2001; Toulmin, 1996a, 1996b, 1996c, 2001; Schwandt, 2002; Ram\u00edrez, 1995; Dunne, 1993; Polkinghorne, 2004). The separation is usually done in order to emphasize phr\u00f3n\u00easis as an independent alternative to epist\u00eam\u00ea and t\u00e9khn\u00ea, or to \u201cscience\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d. Phr\u00f3n\u00easis is seen as deliberation connected to praxis, interpreted as approximately our everyday activities, contrasted to science and technique. Often, rhetoric is also mustered as the deliberative rationality most appropriate for"
