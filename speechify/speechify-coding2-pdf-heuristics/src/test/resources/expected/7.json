    "text": "This system of signs may be understood as language-like because it has a consistent structure that requires signs to be sequentially ordered according to who, what, how, and when. \u201cWho\u201d must be signed first to distinguish between performers in the group; \u201cwhat\u201d must be signed second to determine what content is to be performed; and \u201cwhen\u201d should always be signed last as this instigates performer contribution. Signs are issued with the Soundpainter standing up with bent knees\u2014the bent knees symbolize preparation and inform the group to \u201cget ready\u201d (Ibid.). \u201cWhen\u201d gestures are signed in an imaginary \u201cbox\u201d in front of the Soundpainter: when the Soundpainter leans into the \u201cbox\u201d the performers react to the signs. \u201cHow\u201d the material is to be performed is an optional part of the language: the Soundpainter can choose whether to indicate volume and tempo. How content should be played can be imposed, but there is the opportunity to leave some aspects entirely up to the performer. When \u201chow\u201d is determined, it must be signed before \u201cwhen,\u201d to ensure that it is applied to content."

    "text": "Although signs have a defined meaning, they are not entirely prescriptive. Like verbal language, which can be tailored to generate a personal style and tone, Soundpainting encourages individual contributions from the performers. Most notably, individual contributions are fostered by using \u201csculpting\u201d gestures: these are gestures which search for material without determining exactly what is to be performed. For example, the Soundpainter might start a performance by searching for a sound which is not of the painter\u2019s choosing by signing \u201cpoint to point\u201d: the Soundpainter points at individual performers requesting them to play anything of their choosing as long as they are being pointed at. Each time the performer is pointed at he or she must offer new material. Once the material is offered the Soundpainter can either stop it, or negotiate with the performer to alter and develop the content."

    "text": "The labeling of gestures seems all-important in establishing their communicative process. The \u201ciconic\u201d status afforded these gestures by Thompson establishes them as signs with direct reference to artistic elements. They are gestures that represent the sound produced through our metaphorical understanding of music as a spatial and temporal art form. By classifying them as \u201ciconic\u201d (Thompson 2010), Thompson recognizes an inherent reference to everyday language accompanying gestures. Examples of signs created to relate to everyday activities include the following: \u201cvolume fader,\u201d which is based on a studio reference to amplifier faders in that they can be pushed up and down in a straight line by the fingers; and \u201cplay,\u201d which is taken from bowling. The release of the ball is equated to the start of the gesture response, the point at which the performer must react to the Soundpainter\u2019s request. Other, more advanced, gestures correlate to everyday functions: the turning of a key in a lock by a single hand equates to the musical \u201ckey\u201d and so allows the Soundpainter to request modulations and specific tonal regions."

    "text": "Soundpainting emphasizes the problematic lexicon musicians and dancers share in that its language is often insufficient, contradictory or metaphorical. The term Soundpainting itself, for example, is perplexing and demonstrates the metaphorical basis of the gestures as well as the mapping between the audio and visual elements which is integral to this creative process: a gesture is a silent movement, which bears meaning, but is only realized when someone responds by interpreting it in sound and/or movement. Figure 1 illustrates how a dialogue is formed between the Soundpainter and performer: it represents the reciprocal nature of Soundpainting in the reliance of Soundpainter on the ensemble and vice versa."

They identify three dimensions that offer a useful frame to reassess the gesture types used in Soundpainting. First, gesture is a type of non-verbal communication, as also exposed by Lidov: \u201c[a] true gesture is a precise non-verbal articulation\u201d (Lidov 2006, 30). Second, as Soundpainting sets up a system of gesture"
