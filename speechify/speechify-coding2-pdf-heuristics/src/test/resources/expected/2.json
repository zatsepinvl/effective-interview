Most will fall in the middle range, but some won\u2019t. So there really is a large variation, and there are people who are even further outside of those ranges believe it or not. Below, I show how to use the activity multiplier, notice there is a range at each level to represent individual differences."

However, if you want to get started faster, just take the middle value of 1.7 as your multiplier. Then, if you gain or lose weight too quickly after 2\u20133 weeks, just adjust your intake. This is a perfectly valid approach as well."
